# Simple-Client-Server-Application

I wanted to build this quite simple application, since some things might have been difficult 
to understand at Uni.

This program is intended to put myself in a "comfortable" position for Operating Systems Programming.

Classes have been difficult, but i hope that with this project they get a bit easier
for me to understand.

Enjoy :))
